In 2020, we introduced the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) as a way for the mapping community to exchange and consolidate mappings using a simple TSV format. SSSOM seeks to solve, in particular, the following problems:

- Standardising the mapping metadata that is necessary to drive data transformation and knowledge graph merging use cases
- Enable effective merging and filtering of mapping sets
- Standardising the representation of mapping sets across formats such as RDF/XML, JSON-LD, TSV, and others.

The *purpose* of this 3-hour workshop:

- Describing current use cases to the community, and ensuring all community use cases are documented and understood
- Establishing a user forum for getting support and providing feedback
- Define a simple governance strategy for organic evolution of standard
- Describing a number of key open issues:
    - The representation of complex mappings
    - The representation of curation rules
    - The problem of predicate modification
    - The alignment with external standards such as PROV-O and Alignment API
- Defining the path to a SSSOM beta release (stable) and the rallying for the paper
